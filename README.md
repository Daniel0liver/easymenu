# easymenu
Easymenu is just an online menu that allows merchants to manage their orders more easily.

## Docs
I'm using Mermaidjs to create diagrams. If you're interested in the syntax and possibilities, check out their official [documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).


**Diagrams:**

## Commands
I've created some commands to make it easy to start and stop the server. Check out the [Makefile](https://github.com/Daniel0liver/easymenu/blob/main/Makefile).
